## Pluto's Revenge
The date is August 24, 2006.

Earth has declared Pluto is not a Planet.

Plutonians are enraged by this. They have sent a fleet to wipe out Earth, to ensure Earth won't be a planet either. A lone NASA space shuttle is sent into orbit at the last moment with an infinite source of missiles.

Protect Earth's status as a planet!
